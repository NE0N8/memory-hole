# memory-hole
A website template for serving dynamic content with PHP and Javascript. 
<br>Live demo: http://memoryhole.synergize.co/
<br><br>
Originally developed for an anonymous client, this website contained roughly 3 GB of data; including 340 archived documents, more than 250 links to other websites, and over 2100 images. The website features a PHP-based search function that queries a MySQL database, a drop-down menu with interactive elements written in Javascript, and a responsive mobile-optimized design using custom CSS.
<br><br>
With the client's permission, the full code is being made available for public use on the condition that all references to the previously mentioned files are removed. Any such information has been programatically overwritten with placeholder text using a custom PHP script, which is included with the main website files to simplify the removal of this text. These files are freely available for use in other websites.
